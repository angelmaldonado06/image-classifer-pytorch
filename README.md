# Image Classifier with PyTorch (Udacity Project)

This project is an image classification model built as the final project for Udacity’s **AI Programming with Python** course.

The model uses **transfer learning with VGG16** to classify images of flowers into **102 categories**.

## Features
- Image preprocessing and data augmentation
- Transfer learning using a pretrained VGG16 model
- Custom classifier built with PyTorch
- Training, validation, and test evaluation
- Model checkpoint saving and loading
- Top-5 image prediction with class names

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled flower images split into training, validation, and test sets.

## Results
The trained model achieves strong accuracy on the test set and can predict the top 5 most likely flower classes for a given image.
